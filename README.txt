    Description:
        This is a project about analysis on the data we have scrapped on the website Immoweb.

        The goal is to create two graphs that answer to a question we can ask to our data set. 
        More info in the file data_analyse/presentation.py

        But the first question is wich fields should be mandatory to fill if we want to have a better data set
        and better view of how to sell the house
