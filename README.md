# Real-Estate-Price-Prediction:

## Description : 

This is a project about analysis on the data we have scrapped on the website Immoweb.

The goal is to create two graphs that answer to a question we can ask to our data set. 
More info in the file data_analyse/presentation.py

But the first question is wich fields should be mandatory to fill if we want to have a better data set
and better view of how to sell the house.

This project uses **linear regression**, **logistic**, **random forest**, and **neural network** models
