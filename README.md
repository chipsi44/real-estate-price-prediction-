# Real-Estate-Price-Prediction:

## Description : 

This is a project about price prediction on the website Immoweb.<br>

In the first part I get the data by scrapping them from Immoweb. More info in results !(Folder : data_aquisition)<br>

Once I had the data set I needed to understand it, so I had to clean the data and ask some question to my dataset and then I could make interpretation on the data ! More info in the folder : data_analyse <br>
In this folder you'll find **presentation.py** where you can find the code to create the two graphs presented in results <br>

Then I had to predict prices on Belgium's real estate sales. So I had to use machine learning, here's the step : <br>
select a model, train, test and evaluate it my dataset.<br>
In results you'll find the test and evaluation of differents model
This project uses **linear regression**, **logistic**, **random forest**, and **neural network** models
